1. e4 {I\'m the 16th undisputed world chess champion...} 1... c6 2. d4 {...and
I\'ve been the number #1 player in the world since 2011...} 2... d5 3. e5
{...let\'s see how long you last. Good luck $1} 3... c5 4. Nf3 {I can appreciate a
good knight every once in awhile.} 4... cxd4 {This is where the real fun
begins $1} 5. c3 {I don\'t really make small talk when I play. I can\'t control what
the bot version of me does, though.} 5... dxc3 {I like that move for you.} 6.
Nxc3 {You can always restart this game if you need. There\'s a button down there
somewhere.} 6... e6 7. Bg5 {If there\'s one thing you don\'t want to be, it\'s
behind in development.} 7... Be7 {It seems like you want my bishop.} 8. Be3 {I
don\'t think I\'ll take that trade.} 8... Nh6 {...I don\'t know about that...} 9.
Bd3 {This is a fun way of developing.} 9... Nc6 {Self-confidence is very
important. It is better to overestimate your prospects than underestimate them.}
10. Bxh6 {Let\'s trade.} 10... gxh6 {Very reasonable, yes.} 11. O-O {King safety
is important indeed $1} 11... a6 12. Rc1 {You are stronger than I thought. Is that
true $2 I don\'t know. I was programmed to say that.} 12... Bd7 {My rating is
almost 2900. Is there any tougher bot you can find $2} 13. Ne2 {My dad, Henrik,
was rated almost 2100. He\'s probably better than your dad.} 13... Qb8
{...hmm....} 14. Re1 {I\'ve won the world title in every time control.} 14...
Nxe5 15. Ng3 {The real me would probably play a better move, but the bot me will
settle for that.} 15... Nxd3 16. Qxd3 {I can always get out of a jam like that.}
16... Qf4 {This is an interesting position.} 17. Nh5 Qg4 {My knight is starting
to feel some pressure.} 18. Ng3 {I hope my bot doesn\'t say something every time
I make the best move. It\'s probably quite annoying.} 18... Bb5 {Smart move.} 19.
Qc3 {I normally do what my intuition tells me to. Most of the time spent
thinking is just to double-check.} 19... O-O {That is a fantastic find.} 20. h3
Qg6 {I think you might have a slight advantage.} 21. Ne5 {Tweet at me if you
beat my bot so I can ignore it.} 21... Qg5 22. Nf3 Bf6 23. Qc7 {I really
appreciate how powerful the queen is. Such a fun piece to move.} 23... Qg6 24.
Ne5 {The tension is building.} 24... Bxe5 25. Rxe5 {Let\'s take.} 25... Bc6 {It\'s
good to see you find defensive moves like that.} 26. Qb6 {Let\'s slide this piece
over here. Don\'t worry, it\'s a good move.} 26... Rac8 {You\'re making some good
moves.} 27. Kh2 {If you\'re wondering, that was the best move.} 27... Rfd8 28.
Qd4 {I don\'t want to calculate this too deep, let\'s just play a move.} 28... Bb5
29. Rc3 Rxc3 {I really like that move. Pat yourself on the back.} 30. Qxc3 {I
think I\'ll take.} 30... Bc6 31. Qd4 Re8 {Sure, why not.} 32. Rh5 Qg7 33. Qd2
{Let\'s go here.} 33... d4 34. Rxh6 Kh8 {I respect you for challenging me. But I
don\'t fear you.} 35. Kg1 Rg8 36. Rh5 {I started to play chess because my sisters
were better than me and I wanted to win. Now $2 I think I\'m slightly better.}
36... e5 37. b3 {This will do.} 37... Be8 {Okay.} 38. h4 f6 39. Rh6 Bc6 {That
seems like a smart, reasonable move.} 40. Kh2 f5 41. Rh5 f4 42. Rg5 fxg3+ {How
dare you $2} 43. Kxg3 {Takes.} 43... Qf6 {I like that move for you.} 44. f3 {I
don\'t think the best move is obvious here.} 44... e4 {Good move.} 45. fxe4
{Let\'s make a trade.} 45... Bxe4 46. Qf4 {This is a really fun move. Fun for me,
at least.} 46... Qxf4+ {Thank you for trading.} 47. Kxf4 Rxg5 {Not many people
can reach an endgame against me. And even less win.} 48. hxg5 Bxg2 49. Kg3 Bc6
50. Kf4 Kg7 {Good. People forget the king can become an active piece, too.} 51.
a4 {This move is excellent, if I do say so myself.} 51... a5 {Not many people
have lasted 50 moves in a game against me. You have, of course, because this is
a bot version of me. You get the idea.} 52. Kg3 {During the World Championship
in 2021, I won a 136 move game after nearly 8 hours. Let\'s hope this is
quicker $1} 52... Kg6 53. Kf4 {Even I need to defend sometime.} 53... Kh5 54. Kg3
Kxg5 55. Kf2 h5 56. Ke2 h4 57. Kf2 h3 58. Ke2 h2 59. Kd3 h1=Q {Promoting $2 I\'m as
impressed as a bot version of myself can be.} 60. Kxd4 Qc1 61. Kd3 Bf3 62. Kd4
Kf6 63. Kd3 Ke5 64. b4 axb4 65. a5 Qc3# {Wow, you got me $1 How about a rematch $2}
