1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 {This is where the real fun begins $1} 4...
dxc6 5. O-O {Its nice of you to take care of your king $1} 5... Qf6 {I really
appreciate how powerful the queen is. Such a fun piece to move.} 6. d4 exd4
{Takes.} 7. Qxd4 {I like that move for you.} 7... Qxd4 8. Nxd4 Nf6 {You can
always restart this game if you need. There\'s a button down there somewhere.} 9.
Re1 {It\'s good to see you find defensive moves like that.} 9... Bg4 {This is a
fun way of developing.} 10. Nd2 {Self-confidence is very important. It is better
to overestimate your prospects than underestimate them.} 10... O-O-O {If you\'re
wondering, that was the best move.} 11. N4f3 {Good move.} 11... h6 {This move is
excellent, if I do say so myself.} 12. h3 {It seems like you want my bishop.}
12... Be6 {When you are behind there are two strategies  counter-attack or all
men to the defenses.} 13. e5 {My knight is starting to feel some pressure.}
13... Nd5 {I can appreciate a good knight every once in awhile.} 14. Ne4 {...I
don\'t know about that...} 14... Nb4 {This is a really fun move. Fun for me, at
least.} 15. Re2 {This is an interesting position.} 15... Bc4 {The tension is
building.} 16. Rd2 {I like that move for you.} 16... Bd5 {I\'m quite good in
positions with a strong bishop like this. Also, all other positions.} 17. Nc3
{Sure, why not.} 17... Bxf3 {It\'s only natural that I\'d find such a great move
and be so modest about it.} 18. gxf3 Rxd2 19. Bxd2 {Not many people can reach an
endgame against me. And even less win.} 19... Nxc2 {Let\'s take.} 20. Rd1 Be7
{Let\'s go here.} 21. Be3 {You\'re making some good moves.} 21... Rd8 {Let\'s slide
this piece over here. Don\'t worry, it\'s a good move.} 22. Rxd8+ {Thank you for
trading.} 22... Kxd8 {I don\'t really make small talk when I play. I can\'t
control what the bot version of me does, though.} 23. Kf1 {I respect you for
challenging me. But I don\'t fear you.} 23... Kd7 {A world champion uses all of
their pieces.} 24. f4 {Very reasonable, yes.} 24... Ke6 25. Ke2 {Good. People
forget the king can become an active piece, too.} 25... Nb4 {My dad, Henrik, was
rated almost 2100. He\'s probably better than your dad.} 26. a3 {That seems like
a smart, reasonable move.} 26... Nd5 {I hope my bot doesn\'t say something every
time I make the best move. It\'s probably quite annoying.} 27. Nxd5 {My rating is
almost 2900. Is there any tougher bot you can find $2} 27... cxd5 {Let\'s see what
you do about this pawn.} 28. b4 {Okay.} 28... b6 29. a4 Bxb4 {I think I\'ll
take.} 30. Kd3 c5 {I\'ve won the world title in every time control.} 31. Bd2 Bxd2
32. Kxd2 {Smart move.} 32... Kf5 33. Ke3 d4+ {Just checking what you are up to.}
34. Kf3 b5 35. axb5 axb5 36. h4 c4 37. h5 b4 {Tweet at me if you beat my bot so
I can ignore it.} 38. Ke2 Kxf4 {The real me would probably play a better move,
but the bot me will settle for that.} 39. e6 fxe6 40. f3 e5 41. Kf2 {...hmm....}
41... b3 42. Kg2 c3 43. Kh3 Kxf3 44. Kh4 b2 45. Kh3 d3 46. Kh4 {You might have a
good chance of getting out of this if the app crashes.} 46... b1=Q 47. Kh3 Qh1#

excellent, if I do say so myself.} 12. h3 {It seems like you want my bishop.}
12... Be6 {When you are behind there are two strategies  counter-attack or all
men to the defenses.} 13. e5 {My knight is starting to feel some pressure.}
13... Nd5 {I can appreciate a good knight every once in awhile.} 14. Ne4 {...I
don\'t know about that...} 14... Nb4 {This is a really fun move. Fun for me, at
least.} 15. Re2 {This is an interesting position.} 15... Bc4 {The tension is
building.} 16. Rd2 {I like that move for you.} 16... Bd5 {I\'m quite good in
positions with a strong bishop like this. Also, all other positions.} 17. Nc3
{Sure, why not.} 17... Bxf3 {It\'s only natural that I\'d find such a great move
and be so modest about it.} 18. gxf3 Rxd2 19. Bxd2 {Not many people can reach an
endgame against me. And even less win.} 19... Nxc2 {Let\'s take.} 20. Rd1 Be7
{Let\'s go here.} 21. Be3 {You\'re making some good moves.} 21... Rd8 {Let\'s slide
this piece over here. Don\'t worry, it\'s a good move.} 22. Rxd8+ {Thank you for
trading.} 22... Kxd8 {I don\'t really make small talk when I play. I can\'t
control what the bot version of me does, though.} 23. Kf1 {I respect you for
challenging me. But I don\'t fear you.} 23... Kd7 {A world champion uses all of
their pieces.} 24. f4 {Very reasonable, yes.} 24... Ke6 25. Ke2 {Good. People
forget the king can become an active piece, too.} 25... Nb4 {My dad, Henrik, was
rated almost 2100. He\'s probably better than your dad.} 26. a3 {That seems like
a smart, reasonable move.} 26... Nd5 {I hope my bot doesn\'t say something every
time I make the best move. It\'s probably quite annoying.} 27. Nxd5 {My rating is
almost 2900. Is there any tougher bot you can find $2} 27... cxd5 {Let\'s see what
you do about this pawn.} 28. b4 {Okay.} 28... b6 29. a4 Bxb4 {I think I\'ll
take.} 30. Kd3 c5 {I\'ve won the world title in every time control.} 31. Bd2 Bxd2
32. Kxd2 {Smart move.} 32... Kf5 33. Ke3 d4+ {Just checking what you are up to.}
34. Kf3 b5 35. axb5 axb5 36. h4 c4 37. h5 b4 {Tweet at me if you beat my bot so
I can ignore it.} 38. Ke2 Kxf4 {The real me would probably play a better move,
but the bot me will settle for that.} 39. e6 fxe6 40. f3 e5 41. Kf2 {...hmm....}
41... b3 42. Kg2 c3 43. Kh3 Kxf3 44. Kh4 b2 45. Kh3 d3 46. Kh4 {You might have a
good chance of getting out of this if the app crashes.} 46... b1=Q 47. Kh3 Qh1#
{You fought well. How about a rematch $2} 0-1: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
