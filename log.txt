a pleasant position. Black\'s idea is to exchange on d4 and get the knight to c6.

a5 $5 16. Bb2 a4 17. Bxc6 bxc6 18. Qxd4 Qxd4 19. Bxd4 Be6 {with a drawish endgame
a pawn down. In hindsight, it seems like Gukesh\'s move turns out to be better
because it led to a win, but 13...e5 is objectively correct.}) 14. b3 $6 {Not the
most energetic move.} (14. Qe2 $1 {is the best, preparing to bring the rook to d1.
Black is in danger, and this is a moment that Ding will certainly regretI can\'t
imagine him losing this position.} 14... a6 (14... e5 15. Rd1 Qe7 16. b3 $1 {with
the idea of Ba3. White has a clear advantage. The bishop on g2 is a monster
piece.}) (14... Qf6 15. Be3 {with a lot of pressure. The pawn on b2 cannot be
captured:} 15... Bxe3 16. Qxe3 Qxb2 $2 17. Rab1 Qf6 18. Nc7 Rb8 19. Bxc6 {winning
a piece.}) 15. Rd1 Qe7 (15... Qf6 16. Nc3 Nd4 17. Qe4 {with a clear advantage
for White.}) 16. Nc3 {with a comfortable advantage.}) 14... a6 15. Nc3 (15.
Nd6 $6 {is met by} 15... Bd4) (15. Qxd8 {Exchanging queens is possible, but the
position is close to equality after} 15... Rxd8 16. Nc3 Bd4 17. Bb2) 15... Bd4
16. Bb2 (16. Qc2 {is possible to give the bishop another destination, but Black
is fine:} 16... e5 17. Be3 Bg4) 16... e5 17. Qd2 $1 {A good square for the queen.}
({The natural} 17. Qe2 {can be answered by} 17... Qg5 $1 {and the black queen
finds a good position on the kingside, supporting a possible Bg4.}) 17... Be6
(17... Qa5 $5 {is possible. If White tries a3-b4, then after} 18. a3 Be6 19. b4
Qd8 {the c4-pawn is weakened.}) 18. Nd5 b5 {A good move, breaking White\'s
structure and trying to destabilize the knight on d5. This hint of activity
bothered Ding, who inexplicably decided to simplify the position instead of
fighting for the initiative.} 19. cxb5 $6 {A positional mistake as the knight
loses its formidable position in the center.} ({White could have tried to apply
pressure with} 19. Bxd4 Nxd4 20. f4 $1 {also trying to destabilize the knight on
d4. After} 20... bxc4 21. bxc4 Rc8 22. Rac1 {White doesn\'t run many risks and
still has a small advantage. The knight on d5 is stronger than the one on d4,
and the pawn on c4 is isolated, but it\'s also passed.}) 19... axb5 20. Nf4 {This
is Ding\'s idea, forcing many piece exchanges.} 20... exf4 21. Bxc6 Bxb2 22. Qxb2
Rb8 23. Rfd1 {The game is heading for a draw. At this point, likely no one could
expect a different result than this. But chess, like sports and life in general,
can surprise us.} 23... Qb6 24. Bf3 (24. Bd7 {is also possible, with the idea of
\u200b\u200bexchanging bishops, since after that the endgames become easier to draw even
if White loses a pawn on the queenside. The light-square weaknesses on the
kingside may seem scary, but they cannot be exploited.}) 24... fxg3 25. hxg3 b4
{Of course, the position is drawn. But in practice, it\'s more comfortable to
play as Black due to the better pawn structure. In addition, Ding was in time
trouble and his last moves showed a great desire to fight desperately for a
draw, which must have increased Gukesh\'s confidence.} 26. a4 {The idea is to
offer a pawn on the queenside to simplify the game further and go for a
theoretically drawn endgame.} (26. Bd5 {is possible, with the idea mentioned
before: to exchange bishops and arrive at an endgame a pawn down that is easier
to defend.}) 26... bxa3 27. Rxa3 g6 28. Qd4 Qb5 29. b4 Qxb4 30. Qxb4 Rxb4 31.
Ra8 Rxa8 32. Bxa8 {Without rooks or bishops, the endgame is easily drawn, and
Gukesh wouldn\'t even try too much. But with rooks and bishops, it\'s possible to
play with some hope of winning, although it would take a lot of optimism to
really believe that the last game of a world championship match would end in a
decisive result in such a position.} 32... g5 {Improving the pawn structure on
the kingside. Black can play for hours on end before finally demonstrating a
plan, which makes defense unpleasant. As expected, the game went on for many
moves without a change in the assessment.} 33. Bd5 Bf5 {Of course, Black isn\'t
willing to exchange bishops.} 34. Rc1 Kg7 35. Rc7 Bg6 36. Rc4 Rb1+ {No rook
exchange either.} 37. Kg2 Re1 38. Rb4 h5 39. Ra4 Re5 40. Bf3 Kh6 41. Kg1 Re6 42.
Rc4 g4 43. Bd5 Rd6 44. Bb7 Kg5 45. f3 {Ding decides to exchange pawns, which is
usually a good defensive strategy. Of course, he could have also kept waiting.}
45... f5 46. fxg4 hxg4 47. Rb4 Bf7 48. Kf2 Rd2+ 49. Kg1 Kf6 50. Rb6+ Kg5 (50...

Rf4 (54. Ra5 {prevents the king from going to e5.}) 54... Ke5 {As the draw looks
more and more inevitable, suddenly a surprising turn of events immediately
finishes the game and the match.} 55. Rf2 $4 {A heartbreaking end to a dramatic
match. This horrible blunder allows Black to liquidate into a winning pawn
endgame.} (55. Ra4 {Black has no winning plan, although Gukesh would have played
many more moves.}) 55... Rxf2 56. Kxf2 Bd5 $1 57. Bxd5 Kxd5 58. Ke3 Ke5 {Gukesh
makes history and becomes the youngest undisputed classical world champion
ever.} (58... Ke5 59. Kd3 f4) 0-1
